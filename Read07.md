The first thing you should do is detail your goals for
the script (what you want it to achieve):

Customers can have a name added to a plaque; each
letter costs $5. When a user enters a name, show
them how much it will cost.
Next, break it into a series of tasks that have to be
performed in order to achieve the goals:
1. The script is triggered when the button is clicked.

2. It collects the name entered into the form field.

3. It checks that the user has entered a value.

4. If the user has not entered anything, a message
will appear telling them to enter a name.

5. If a name has been entered, calculate the cost of
the sign by multiplying the number of letters by
the cost per letter.

6. Show how much the plaque costs. 

**A script is a series of instructions that the computer**
can follow in order to achieve a goal.
*Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of
all the instructions.
*Computers approach tasks in a different way than
humans, so your instructions must let the computer
solve the task prggrammatically.
*To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task (a flowchart can help).
